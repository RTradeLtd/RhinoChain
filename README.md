# RhinoChain
RhinoChain is a PoC Blockchain built ontop of IPFS, utilizing Temporal for all interactions with the IPFS network. This is intended to demo example applications that can be built ontop of Temporal

Inspiration, and code portions are used from https://github.com/whyrusleeping/toychain which has served as the inspiration for this PoC.


This will most likely never become a full product beyond a hobby project I work on from time-to-time, and as an example app that can be built utlizing the temporal library.
